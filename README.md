About Remoteroid
------------------
Remoteroid is a remote control solution for Android platform, including features like Drag-and-drop file transfer and delivering phone's notifications(Incoming call, Message, Notifications from apps, etc).

You can control your Phone on your PC without leaving your hands from keyboard and mouse.

Stable version of Remoteroid is available on Google code, but It only supports Windows. In addition, by now, **Remoteroid requires root permission** on the device. We're finding another way to run Remoteroid that doesn't requires root permission. Please stay tuned for new releases. And if you have any idea about 'Non-rooting approach', please contact to jyte82@gmail.com.
